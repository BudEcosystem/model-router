    "\n",
    "The notebook has been developed as part of a research initiative at BUD to survey the capabilities of the current SOTA techniques in the area of natural language inference optimization, more specficially, language model routing. In this notebook, we present a faithful reproduction of a SOTA methodology presented in the 2024 paper '**RouteLLM: Learning to Route LLMs with Preference Data**' ([Ong et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18665)). This notebook covers everything from data preparation to router benchmarking, and provides an in-depth look at how the Muffler-$\\alpha$ router functions, including its model routing logic, training approach, and cost-adjustment mechanisms. It can be useful for researchers or developers seeking to optimize language model usage in cost-sensitive environments or for those interested in implementing cost efficient routing mechanisms."

    "### Model Recipe - Building the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Before defining the architecture for the Language Model (LM) router, it is essential to take foundational steps to ensure effective model convergence. A critical part of this process involves creating a well-structured, supervised training dataset. Such a dataset might have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "id [INT] | model_a [STR] | model_b [STR] | prompt [STR] | winner_model_a [0/1] | winner_model_b [0/1] | tie_ab [0/1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents a comparison between two models (`model_a` and `model_b`) based on their responses to a specific `prompt`. The outcomes (`winner_model_a`, `winner_model_b`, or `tie_ab`) indicate which model performed better or if there was a tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Augmentations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Benchmark Augmented Datasets**\n",
    "   - These datasets are derived by evaluating models across well-established benchmarks. Benchmarks typically focus on specific domains of reasoning.\n",
    "   - By comparing the performance of a stronger model $M_{strong}$ and a weaker model $M_{weak}$ on these benchmarks, metrics such as *accuracy* or *exact match* can be collected. These metrics determine which model performs better for a given prompt. \n",
    "   - Such datasets are often referred to as *Golden Labelled Datasets* because they provide a clear indication of model aptitude within specific domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Human Augmented Datasets**\n",
    "   - Publicly available datasets that capture human preferences for language model responses can also be used. Examples include:\n",
    "     - **`lmarena-ai/arena-human-preference-55k`**\n",
    "     - **`lmarena-ai/PPE-Human-Preference-V1`**\n",
    "   - These datasets reflect the nuanced preferences humans may have for certain types of responses. However, a potential downside is that they may introduce inherent biases into the training data. These biases can affect the router's performance in unpredictable ways. Moreover, obtaining a sufficient amount of datapoints in such augmentations is a costly & time consuming business.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **LLM Judge Augmented Datasets**\n",
    "   - To reduce reliance on human-annotated preferences and address potential human biases, a *Language Model Judge* (LLM Judge) can be employed. This judge compares responses from an LLM and an SLM (a smaller language model) and assigns a label to the better-performing model.\n",
    "   - The resulting datasets, known as *LLM Preference Datasets*, aim to offer a more balanced and scalable alternative to human-augmented datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each dataset type comes with strengths and limitations:**\n",
    "- **Benchmark Augmented Datasets** ensure strong domain coverage but may lack the richness of human preferences.\n",
    "- **Human Preference Datasets** capture real-world preferences but risk introducing subjective biases.\n",
    "- **LLM Preference Datasets** strike a balance by leveraging the capabilities of an LLM as a neutral arbiter, though the quality of the \"judge\" becomes critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus begin by importing relevant python libraries."

    "### APGR\n",
    "\n",
    "APGR (Average Performance Gap Recovered) is a metric used to assess the effectiveness of LLM routers. It quantifies how well a router can bridge the performance difference between a weaker, more cost-effective LLM and a stronger, more expensive one. The performance gap is the difference in quality between the outputs of a strong LLM (like GPT-4) and a weak LLM/SLM (like Mixtral-8x7B). This gap is usually measured using benchmark datasets or human evaluations. Routers aim to \"recover\" this performance gap by intelligently deciding which LLM to use for a given query. Ideally, they'd route simple queries to the weak model and complex ones to the strong model, maximizing quality while minimizing cost. APGR measures the router's ability to recover this performance gap across a range of cost constraints. It's calculated as the area under the router's performance curve (plotting quality against the percentage of calls to the strong model). A higher APGR value indicates that the router is more effective at selecting the appropriate LLM for different types of queries. This means it can achieve a good balance between cost-efficiency and response quality.\n",

    "### AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC is calculated as the Area Under the Call-Performance Curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AUC at 1: Implies maximum routing performance.\n",
    "- AUC close to 1:  Suggests the router effectively routes most queries to the appropriate model (strong or weak), achieving near-optimal performance.\n",
    "- AUC close to 0.5:  Indicates the router performs similarly to a random routing strategy, showing limited effectiveness in differentiating between query types.\n",
    "- AUC below 0.5: Implies the router might be making poor routing decisions, potentially performing worse than random chance.\n",
    "- AUC at 0: Lowest tier performance across all samples."
